# EZ Vite Net Starter (EZVN)

EZ Vite Net Starter is an npm package that runs a series of scripts that help you quickly start an Vite frontend with a ASP Net backend API!

This allows you to create a template without the need of Visual Studio and allows the flexibility to use the latest versions of both Vite and .Net (something that .Net's built-in templates struggle with).
